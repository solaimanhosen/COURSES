During the recent decade, rapid advancements in healthcare services and low cost wireless communication have greatly assisted in coping with the problem of fewer medical facilities. The integration of mobile communications with wearable sensors has facilitated the shift of healthcare services from clinic-centric to patient-centric and is termed as “Telemedicine” in the literature [1]. In the larger perspective, telemedicine can be of two types: (1) live communication type, where the presence of the doctor and patient is necessary with additional requirements of high bandwidth and good data speed, and (2) store and forward type, which requires acquisition of medical parameters such as vital signs, images, videos, and transmission of patients data to concerned specialist in hospital [2, 3].

According to existing medical surveys, telemedicine has been adopted to take care of the patients with cardiac diseases, diabetes, hypotension, hypertension, hyperthermia, and hypothermia [4–8]. The most promising application is in real-time monitoring of chronic illnesses such as cardiopulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure in patients located far from the medical care facilities through wireless monitoring systems [9]. Heart diseases have become one of the leading causes of human fatalities around the world; for instance, approximately 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese as obesity can lead to adverse metabolic effects on blood pressure and cholesterol which ultimately increases the risks of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, diabetes mellitus, and a number of common cancers [10]. According to WHO, it has been estimated that heart disease rate might increase to 23.3% worldwide by the year 2030 [11]. The treatment of such chronic diseases requires continuous and long term monitoring to control threat.
